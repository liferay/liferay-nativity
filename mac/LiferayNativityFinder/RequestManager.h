 * Changes:
 * - (Andrew Rondeau) Started tracking programname in the socket's userData, so
 * different programs don't conflict with each other
 * - (Andrew Rondeau) Switched to NSHashTable for performance reasons
 * - (Andrew Rondeau) Added command to repaint all windows, added ability to query
 * the program for the file's icon, made getting the context manu faster
